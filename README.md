## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Download the installer** from the [latest release](https://github.com/StaticHumStudio/NineLivesAudio/releases/latest)
2. **Run `NineLivesAudioSetup.exe`**

> ⚠️ **Windows SmartScreen Warning?** You'll likely see "Windows protected your PC" because this app uses a self-signed certificate. This is completely normal for open-source projects. Here's how to proceed safely:
>
> 1. Click **"More info"**
> 2. Verify the publisher shows **"Static Hum Studio"**
> 3. Click **"Run anyway"**
>
> *Why does this happen?* Microsoft only trusts expensive certificates from big companies ($300-500/year). As a free, open-source project, we use a self-signed certificate. You can verify the code is safe by reviewing the source yourself - everything's right here on GitHub!

3. **Launch Nine Lives Audio** from your Start Menu
4. **Connect to your Audiobookshelf server** in Settings
5. **Start listening!** 🎉

### First-Time Setup

1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Enter your Audiobookshelf server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:13378`)
3. Enter your username and password
4. Click "Test Connection"
5. Once connected, your library will sync automatically
